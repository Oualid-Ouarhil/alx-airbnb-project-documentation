User Authentication
Objective:
To securely manage user access to the platform, ensuring that both guests and hosts can register, log in, and manage their profiles. The system will authenticate users through secure methods and store their data safely.

Functional Requirements:
User Registration:

The system must allow guests and hosts to register by providing an email and a password.
Users should also be able to register via OAuth integration (Google, Facebook).
During registration, the system must validate the email format and check for existing accounts.
A confirmation email should be sent to the user upon registration, requiring them to verify their email address.
User Login:

Users must log in using their registered email and password.
The system must support password hashing (e.g., bcrypt) to securely store passwords.
Users can log in via OAuth (Google, Facebook).
The system should provide error messages in case of invalid login credentials (e.g., incorrect password or email).
JWT (JSON Web Token) Authentication:

After a successful login, the system must issue a JWT token to authenticate users for subsequent requests.
The JWT token should have an expiration time (e.g., 24 hours) and should be securely stored in the client (e.g., in HTTP-only cookies).
The system should provide functionality to refresh tokens using a refresh token flow, allowing users to stay logged in for extended periods.
Profile Management:

Users should be able to update their profile information, including:
Name, profile photo, and contact information.
Password change functionality.
Preferred language and notification preferences.
Users can also view their account settings, including the account type (guest or host).
If users forget their password, the system must provide a password reset functionality, with an email containing a reset link.
Security:

All sensitive data (e.g., passwords, tokens) must be transmitted securely using HTTPS.
The system must follow best practices for user session management to prevent session hijacking and CSRF attacks.
Implement rate limiting for login attempts to mitigate brute-force attacks.


Property Management
Objective:
To allow hosts to list, edit, and delete properties, ensuring the platform accurately represents available properties for guests to book.

Functional Requirements:
Add Property Listing:

Hosts should be able to create a new property listing by providing the following details:
Title, description, location (address, city, country).
Price per night, availability dates, property type (apartment, house, etc.).
Amenities (e.g., Wi-Fi, pool, pet-friendly, parking).
Photos (image uploads with size and resolution limits).
Rules (e.g., smoking, check-in/check-out times).
Edit Property Listing:

Hosts should be able to edit any of the property details after initial submission.
The system must support versioning or tracking of changes to avoid accidental data loss.
Delete Property Listing:

Hosts should be able to delete their property listings.
Deleting a property should prompt a confirmation dialog to prevent accidental deletion.
After deletion, the system should update the status of any active bookings to reflect cancellation.
Property Availability Management:

Hosts should be able to update availability for their properties, either by marking specific dates as unavailable or by blocking out certain periods.
The system should automatically show availability conflicts (e.g., double bookings) when a guest attempts to book.
Property Listing Visibility:

Property listings should be visible to guests only if the host has approved them and they have passed any necessary verification (if applicable).
Hosts should have the ability to set the visibility of their property listing (e.g., publish, hide, or draft).
Search and Filtering:

Hosts should be able to add searchable keywords or tags for their listings (e.g., family-friendly, business trip, etc.).
The system should ensure searchable property metadata (price, location, amenities) is indexed for efficient filtering by guests.


Booking System
Objective:
To allow guests to search for, select, and book properties, while enabling hosts to manage and track bookings.

Functional Requirements:
Booking Creation:

Guests must be able to book properties for specified dates.
During booking, guests should specify the number of guests, and any special requests (e.g., late check-in).
The system should validate availability for the selected dates and prevent double bookings.
Booking Cancellation:

Guests or hosts should be able to cancel bookings based on the cancellation policy (e.g., free cancellation up to 48 hours before check-in).
The system should process cancellations by updating booking statuses to "canceled" and notify both parties.
Booking Status:

The system must track booking statuses (e.g., pending, confirmed, completed, canceled).
The system should notify guests and hosts of any status change (e.g., booking confirmation or cancellation).
Booking History:

Both guests and hosts should be able to view a history of their bookings with relevant details (e.g., property name, dates, payment status).
Booking Notifications:

Automated email or in-app notifications should be sent for key events (e.g., booking confirmation, cancellation, upcoming stay reminders).
Payment Integration:

The system must integrate with third-party payment gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) for booking payments.
Payments should be processed upfront at the time of booking, and the system should issue a receipt upon successful payment.
